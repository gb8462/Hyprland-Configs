The script automate Installing Hyprland, wofi ,dolphin, alacritty and waybar, and setting up the wofi, waybar, wallpaper and wlogout, it also set up the sound so I don't have to try and go to the trouble of configuring it for hours!, it also set up grim and slurp for taking screenshots. it also install pipewire, wireplumber and xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland for screen capture!
